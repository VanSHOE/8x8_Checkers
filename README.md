The game can be compiled simply by cloning the git repo and running gcc checkers.c with additional parameters if desired
The controls are mentioned in the instructions.txt which can also be accessed in-game by pressing H

To control the cursor in the menu, use 'w' and 's'
and to change the difficulty in the menu hover over difficulty and use 'a' and 'd' , not this only affects the singleplayer mode

Now the user may select multiplayer or singleplayer as desired and the game will be initalised
The game can further be controlled using WASD to control the red square and space for selection/deselection
Once a successful selection is made, selecting another square will move the desired piece if the move is illegal, else no move will happen

The multijump rule in our game dictates that once a player makes a capture, if any other piece of that player can make a capture, the player is granted another turn

At any point in time, the user can see the instructions to use several of the available features such as review, undo and so on

Note- The undo function while reverses a single move in 2 player mode, it will go back to the last player-made move when it comes to singleplayer 
That is it on how to run and play this game, have fun :)
